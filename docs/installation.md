### Normal installation

To use this library, simply add it as a dependency to your yarn or npm project by running the command:

```php
npm install --save atti-admin
// Or
yarn add atti-admin
```

The library rely on both [atti-components](https://github.com/attineos/atti-components) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/). 
Please make sure that these two libraries are installed.
You also need to have an atti-components's ThemeProvider before calling any of the Form Components in this library.

```php
// Import some components
import { CRUForm } from 'atti-admin'
```
